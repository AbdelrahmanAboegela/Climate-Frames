TextSegment: Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, caused by changes in solar activity or volcanic eruptions. However, since the 1800s, human activities have become the dominant driver of climate change, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect and leading to rising global temperatures.
